# 0202 Happy Number - Easy
# https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
# Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
# Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
# Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
# Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(n))

        return True if n == 1 else False
